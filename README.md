# Super-market
K-Means Clustering
In this session, you will be introduced to an online retail data set, which is a transactional data set. This is used to implement the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster all the customers according to their attributes. It will help in gaining more information about various customer patterns, which the retail store can use in multiple ways:

Focus on the target segment
Take a customer-centric strategy to achieve uniformity and familiarity
Reduce unnecessary inventory
You will learn about the following topics in this session:

Data preparation
Understanding data and data cleaning
How to make clusters
Decide the optimal number of clusters
How to interpret results
Types of behavioural segmentation

In this segment, you will build a clustering model for customer segmentation. The data contains various attributes, such as InvoiceDate, UnitPrice and CustomerID. On the basis of this data, the supermarket wants to segment its customers into clusters based on their shopping patterns. Through this case study, you will learn how to create clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm in Python.
